<div id="paragraph" >
  <p><span class="special">"Behold the mighty wild buffalo"</span>—a true monarch of the untamed wilderness. This powerful creature, with its imposing curved horns and battle-scarred hide, embodies raw strength and resilience. As a keystone species, it shapes entire ecosystems through grazing and wallowing, while its tight-knit herds move with ancient wisdom across savannas and floodplains. More than just an icon of the wild, this buffalo represents nature's delicate balance—its survival ensures biodiversity thrives. Whether standing guard against predators or nurturing new plant growth through its very footsteps, this magnificent animal commands respect. Witnessing one in its natural habitat is glimpsing the untamed heart of the wild itself, a living testament to landscapes untouched by time."</p>
